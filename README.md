Nola.com sanifier
=================

In May 2012, <http://nola.com> underwent an inexplicably bad redesign.
Hopefully it will clean itself up soon, but as long as it's the only New
Orleans local paper, we'll all be needing to read it. So here is a chrome
extension that takes some of the pain away:

 * Electric yellow previously only associated with Eurotrash hatchbacks and
   shoes with LEDs in them replaced with something more subdued.
 * Menubar at the top of the page prevented from following you down as you
   scroll. 
 * Mouseovers that take up 3/4 of the screen disabled. These are set to click
   on touch devices. There's a lesson there.

You can install it directly, in Chrome, by clicking: <https://dinosaur.s3.amazonaws.com/chrome-nola-sanifier.crx>
